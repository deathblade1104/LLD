### LLD: Design Patterns and Java Low-Level Design

This repository is where I learn and practice software design patterns and solve Low-Level Design (LLD) problems in Java. The purpose is to build a strong intuition for designing maintainable, extensible, and testable systems.

## Goals
- Understand classic design patterns (creational, structural, behavioural)
- Implement patterns in idiomatic Java with small runnable examples
- Practice LLD for common real-world interview-style problems

## Repository Structure
- `design-patterns/`
  - `creational/`
    - `simple-factory/` — simple factory demo
    - `factory/` — factory method demo
  - `behavioural/` — behavioural pattern demos (to be added)
- Future: `lld-problems/` — problem statements and solutions (WIP)


## Conventions
- Clear, descriptive names over abbreviations
- Small, focused classes demonstrating one pattern/idea
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Examples should be runnable and self-explanatory

## Roadmap
- Add more creational patterns: builder, prototype, singleton, abstract factory
- Add structural patterns: adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, proxy
- Add behavioural patterns: strategy, observer, command, iterator, mediator, memento, state, template, visitor, chain of responsibility
- Add LLD problems with requirements, approach, class diagrams, and code
